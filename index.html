<ul>
<li>QA group is in charge of e2e tests</li>
</ul>
<!-- To set the scene a little bit, our process at the beginning of -->
<!-- the year relied heavily on our in-house Webdriver framework. Our -->
<!-- devs worked on features and bugfixes and generate builds for us -->
<!-- to test. We'd use a combination of automated tests for -->
<!-- functionality along with manual verification of the newest -->
<!-- features, right, and each sprint our automated test suite would -->
<!-- grow a little bit. -->

<ul>
<li>Established in-house Webdriver framework: Honeydew</li>
</ul>
<!-- Our in-webdriver framework is named Honeydew, as an amazingly -->
<!-- clever pun off of Cucumber. A couple years ago we had decided to -->
<!-- make our own framework in Perl to give us a bit more flexibility, -->
<!-- and it kept us internally consistent, since many of our other -->
<!-- internal tools were written in perl. Other than being in Perl, -->
<!-- the basics are pretty similar- it accepts Gherkin-style -->
<!-- Given-When-Then feature files and parses them into Webdriver -->
<!-- instructions. We use the feature files not only as tests but also -->
<!-- as readable documentation, and as part of our onboarding for new -->
<!-- hires to help them get familiarized with the site. -->

<ul>
<li>Dashboards, nightly monitoring, custom JIRA integrations, email
reporting, ...</li>
</ul>
<!-- We were pretty heavily invested in Webdriver - we've got a custom -->
<!-- IDE for authoring our features, similar to Cucumber Pro's -->
<!-- offerings, dashboards, email reporting, nightly monitoring, -->
<!-- integrations with JIRA, our bug tracker, tie-ins with our -->
<!-- TeamCity CI servers, and a substantial adoption of the Gherkin -->
<!-- syntax. --></section>

    <section class="slide-content"><h3 id="huh-what-s-appium">huh? what&#39;s appium</h3>
<ul>
<li>mobile is the new focus!</li>
</ul>
<!-- Earlier this year, Sharecare decided to prioritize mobile - both -->
<!-- for our website and also in the form of new mobile apps. move -->
<!-- fast without breaking things! For me, this meant we needed to -->
<!-- assess the mobile testing frameworks and come up with a workable -->
<!-- solution. -->

<ul>
<li>Need to test Android and iOS apps from OS X &amp; Windows</li>
</ul>
<!-- Like everyone else, we looked at a number of different -->
<!-- options. We looked briefly into KiF, and we surveyed our options -->
<!-- as well. Appium fit us pretty well for a few reasons  -->

<ul>
<li>Our Webdriver investment + cross-platform testing requirements = Appium!</li>
</ul>
<!-- In the QA group, we had been keeping tabs on Appium since a few -->
<!-- months before the 2013 SeConf, but our devs hadn't heard of -->
<!-- it. We looked into KiF and surveyed our other options, but Appium -->
<!-- seemed like the obvious choice the whole time. -->

<!-- Since it'd be the QA engineers in charge of testing, we'd need to -->
<!-- be the ones familiar with the test framework - while we might not -->
<!-- have developer in our title, our QA engineers all possess the analytic -->
<!-- capabilities to code in Gherkin pseudo language for testing -->
<!-- browsers. We wanted to re-use those same abstractions and make -->
<!-- things easy for our QA group to transition to and from mobile testing. -->

<ul>
<li>Consistent troubleshooting and open source: both pluses!</li>
</ul>
<!-- Working with one tool for both iOS and Android would also make -->
<!-- troubleshooting much easier. Also, using Appium, we'd also get -->
<!-- all of our existing infrastructure for free - reporting, -->
<!-- dashboards, monitoring, etc. -->

<!-- Additionally, the fact that Appium was open source made a big -->
<!-- difference for us as well - being able to interact directly with -->
<!-- the project authors when diagnosing bugs is pretty -->
<!-- invaluable. --></section>
  </div>
  <div class="slide hidden" id="slide-5">
    <section class="slide-content"><h3 id="non-appium-solutions-">non-Appium solutions ?</h3>
<!-- For some of our work, it actually turns out that Appium does have -->
<!-- the functionality to test, but for various reasons we decided to -->
<!-- go other routes. One instance was when we were having issues with -->
<!-- analytics calls on the mobile version of our web app. Appium -->
<!-- definitely has the ability to automate the actual mobile browsers -->
<!-- on a mobile device, but it was less attractive for this case -->
<!-- because our testers for our mobile web app were responsible for a -->
<!-- much wider range of devices, and they weren't using an OS X -->
<!-- machine as their main workstation. -->

<ul>
<li>Is UserAgent spoofing alone a viable choice?</li>
</ul>
<!-- Depending on how your mobile web app is determining its content, -->
<!-- you may have the option of spoofing your desktop browser's user -->
<!-- agent and having it masquerade as a mobile browser. This is a -->
<!-- little tricky, because it's possible the behavior on the -->
<!-- desktop-as-mobile browser isn't an exact match for an actual -->
<!-- mobile browser, but in our case we were able to reproduce the -->
<!-- bug on our desktops and avoid going through some of the Appium -->
<!-- infrastructure setup. -->

<ul>
<li>Or, setting the browser size via Webdriver&#39;s APIs</li>
</ul>
<!-- And, if you're in the lucky case where your web app reflows its -->
<!-- content solely based on browser size, that's happily even easier -->
<!-- than having to spoof your browser size. We have a small table of -->
<!-- mobile browser screen sizes, but I'm sure it's possible to look -->
<!-- 'em up and emulate the mobile device we're hoping to test. -->

<ul>
<li>Exactly what the user sees?</li>
</ul>
<!-- There's definitely a fine line between compromising on testing -->
<!-- exactly what the user sees, and saving yourself devleopment time -->
<!-- by testing in a headless browser, or with a spoofed user -->
<!-- agent. Making that decision really depends on how important the -->
<!-- functionality is, and what kind of bugs are high risk for that -->
<!-- feature. --></section>

<!-- We started out using our normal webdriver bindings. If you're -->
<!-- just doing simple tests like we were at first, it's actually -->
<!-- possible to get a decent amount done without using a specific -->
<!-- client library. Views with only a few forms or flows that are -->
<!-- mostly just clicking are pretty easily accomplished with the -->
<!-- standard Selenium bindings. Early on, this is pretty attractive - -->
<!-- little to no extra effort and a decently big payoff, especially -->
<!-- if you're not doing any mobile specific things like hiding the -->
<!-- keyboard or switching to webviews. -->

<ul>
<li>Started out using our normal webdriver bindings</li>
</ul>
<!-- A big plus for us was that the same way that the standard -->
<!-- Selenium bindings cover a decent amount of Appium functionality -->
<!-- also meant that a number of our step rules carried over from -->
<!-- the desktop version of our framework. So, we get to avoid some -->
<!-- overhead there for our engineers and re-use the syntax they're -->
<!-- already used to! -->

<ul>
<li>Exactly the same Gherkin step rules</li>
</ul>
<!-- From the front-end of our framework, we were able to make it -->
<!-- pretty much a transparent drop in. Just choose 'mobile device' as -->

<!-- get everything in place, and I'm going to dig into some of those -->
<!-- issues that we've learned along the way. -->
