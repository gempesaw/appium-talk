appium-talk
===========

This repo is my talk at the [Appium Roadshow on 2014-08-20](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2014/07/appium-roadshow-nyc/) about how we're using [Appium](http://appium.io) at [Sharecare](http://www.sharecare.com).

The slides are [online](http://danielgempesaw.com/appium-talk), and the notes and source are in [talk.md](talk.md). It uses [cleaver](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cleaver) to transform the markdown into a presentation.
